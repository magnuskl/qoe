                    This web application facilitates QoE studies of panoramic
                    (and conventional) video. It is inteded for use with
                    experiments that follow a full factorial design, meaning
                    that more than one (usually two or three) independent
                    variables assume different discreet values. The material
                    being studied, that is, the panoramic video, is prepared in
                    each possible combination of these values. Each variant is
                    then compared to every other variant in a pairwise manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this particular experiment, the video has been encoded in
                    combinations of three different resolutions (480p, 720p, and
                    1080p) and two different CRF values (23 and 34). This yields
                    3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 variants and
                    6&nbsp;choose&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;15 pairs, noting that
                    variants are compared only once and not with themselves.
                    (Otherwise, there would have been
                    6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;36 pairs.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just to keep track of the progress, the current pair and
                    variant are displayed above the video. However, these
                    numbers do not disclose the properties of each variant (i.e.
                    encoding parameters), which is part of the purpose: it is
                    supposed to be a double-blinded experiment, where neither
                    the instructor nor the participant is biased by knowledge of
                    the likely outcome. Pairs and variants appear in randomized
                    sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The controls are located below the video. Click the Previous
                    and Next buttons to navigate between pairs. Click the Switch
                    button (in the middle) to switch between variants within
                    each pair. Hold and drag the video to change the viewing
                    angle. Select the preferred variant by double-clicking the
                    video or single-clicking the title, which may work better on
                    handheld devices.  A colored border will appear around the
                    video's edge.  Only one variant can be selected; selecting
                    one will automatically deselect the other. All pairs must be
                    assessed to complete the experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases the choice may be all but obvious, while in
                    others it may not. There is no time limit, so take the time
                    needed. There is also no correct or incorrect answer: QoE is
                    a subjective measure. Click the Next button to start the
                    experiment.
